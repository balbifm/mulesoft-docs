= Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition

This section shows you how to install and use both the *Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition* and the *Runtime Manager On-Premise Edition*. The Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition offers all of the features that are available in the online version of the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] as a service that you can run on your local servers, guarded by any security policies you may require.

When you choose to run Anypoint Platform on-premises, MuleSoft systems do not interact with your data at all. You configure and run the software and handle all storing, processing and transmitting of data directly, without interference from MuleSoft.

Similarly, the Runtime Manager On-Premise Edition offers a reduced version of the Anypoint Platform, that only comprises the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] functionality that allows you to deploy applications to your own servers.
