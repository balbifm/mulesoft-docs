= Custom Application Alerts and Notifications

[NOTE]
Custom Alerts and Notifications are a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. They are not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers on-premises. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] for more details.

== Prerequisites

Before going further, complete the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World] example as this builds on top of it. In addition, you need to have "Mavenized" your project within Studio. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/using-maven-with-mule[Using Maven with Mule].

== How to Use Notifications

Notifications give you the ability to give visibility into business related events inside your application. For example, you can raise notifications when:

* Your application is unable to connect to a remote service
* An error occurs which requires human intervention, such as a problem with data mapping
* You want to create a summary of what occurred inside your application, such as the number of orders processed.

In combination with link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[alerts], you can direct these notifications to different people to act on the alerts and fix the underlying problems.

This example illustrates:

* How to send business related events as notifications
* How to send errors as notifications
* How to send email alerts when notifications arrive

You can create alerts in CloudHub through the Runtime Manager console. If you want to create custom alerts, you need to get the CloudHub Connector and install it in Anypoint Studio.

== Installing the CloudHub Connector

To create notifications from your application, get the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/cloudhub-integration-connector[CloudHub connector] from Anypoint Exchange. This connector allows you to create custom notifications inside your flows and inside your exception strategies.

To access the CloudHub connector from Anypoint Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*. In *Work with*, click *Anypoint Connectors Update Site* and in the *Community* category, click *CloudHub Connector*. If this option is not listed, click *Help* > *Installation Details* and see if the connector was previously installed.

Click *Next* > then *Next* again > *I accept the terms of the license agreement*  > *Finish*, and restart Studio.

== Configuring the CloudHub Connector

Add and configure the CloudHub connector to our previous flow in the "Hello World" application referenced at the top of this page.

. In Anypoint Studio, find the *CloudHub* connector on the right menu and then drag and drop it next to the *Set Payload* transformer: 
+

+
. Open the configuration for the CloudHub connector. Create a new *Connector Configuration* for the connector by clicking the plus sign "*+*":
+
image:cloudhub-connector-props-blank.png[cloudhub-connector-props-blank]
+
. For this demo, select *Basic Authentication* configuration, which must be configured with the corresponding *Username* and *Password*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
*Inherited Token Authentication* is a new configuration option that works only when your CloudHub connector's application is run inside a CloudHub instance. With this approach the connector retrieves the API Token from the CloudHub instance where the app is deployed.
+
. Enter your credentials into the configuration fields and click *OK*:
+
image:cloudhub-basic-auth-config.png[cloudhub-basic-auth-config]
+
. Make sure that you have selected the *Create notification* operation and set the properties for:
.. *Domain*: This should be the domain you set for your application when you first created it following the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World] tutorial.
.. *Message*: The message you want your notification to show (e.g. "_Your application has been hit_"). In the example below, the notification will simply display a "_Hello World!_" message.
.. *Priority*: The type of the notification. By selecting "INFO", your notification will display an informative message while selecting "ERROR" will display a red alert message.

+
image:cloudhub-connector-settings.png[cloudhub-connector-settings]
+
. Additional information can be included with the notification by configuring the "Custom Properties" section.
[NOTE]
The expected "Custom Properties" format is `Map <String, String>` and is typically referenced using a bean or a variable where you have defined that map, for example, `\#[flowVars.magicMap]`,
or by defining a map using MEL `#[['key1':'value1']]`

. At this point, your application is set to be deployed and run. When your domain root is visited, the *Create notification* operation in the CloudHub connector creates a "Hello World!" notification message for the domain that the application is currently running on.

[IMPORTANT]
If you always want to create notifications on CloudHub, even when running locally, you can use the *Create notification* operation. This requires you to configure the connector with your username and password.

== Deploying Your Application

To deploy your application, in the Runtime Manager click *Deploy Application* from the *Applications* menu. For more information, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub].

== Triggering Your Notification

Once your application is running, you can trigger the notification by simply going to your application's URL, for example: link:http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/hello-notification[http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/]. The page should display a `Hello World` message, and automatically create a new notification in your Runtime Manager console. Next, return to the Runtime Manager console and click the new notification indicator bell indicator in the upper-right to show the alert message:

image:image2014-10-24+17-41-16-1.png[image2014-10-24+17-41-16-1]

If the notification is sent after an exception, it attaches the
`exception.message` and `exception.stacktrace` as custom properties of the notification, which are accessible from the Runtime Manager console.

== Creating a Custom Alert

Alerts allow you to send emails based on your application notifications. To create a custom alert for your application notification, click your application, and then click *Alerts* from the left menu.

In the *New Alert* dialog:

. Click *New alert*. 
. Enter an alert name, "Hello World".
. Optionally select your application name or leave the selection as "any"
. Select "custom application notification" as the event type
. Enter "Hello" as the word that triggers your notification. Recall the message you configured above is "Hello World!"
. Enter email addresses that you wish to email to
. Click *Create*. 

This creates your alert. Now, trigger your notification again by going to your application's URL, for example: `http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/`. You then receive an email with your notification in it!

== Sending an Error Notification

In addition to sending notifications from business events, you may want to send notifications when errors happen so they can be acted upon. To do this, you can use the CloudHub connector inside a catch exception strategy. To do this, add the following XML to your mule-config.xml:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="create notification from exception">
    <inbound-endpoint address="http://0.0.0.0:${http.port}/create-notification-from-exception"/>
    <scripting:component>
        <scripting:script engine="groovy">
            throw new Exception("Could not connect to remote service.")
        </scripting:script>
    </scripting:component>
    <default-exception-strategy>
        <cloudhub:create-notification message="Error processing transaction." priority="ERROR"/>
    </default-exception-strategy>
</flow>
----

This flow throws an exception and creates a notification from that exception with the message "Error processing transaction." The exception stack trace for the flow is attached to the message. This can optionally be turned off using the `attachStacktrace` attribute.

As before, build and deploy your application, and then go to the URL: `http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/create-notification-from-exception`. Then return to the Runtime Manager console, and a notification pop-up appears in the top-right. Click the notifications link and the notification with the stack trace appears in the notifications list.

To view the whole stack trace and details, click "More..." and the whole message appears in a pop-up window:
